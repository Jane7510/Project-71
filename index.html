          <h3>STEM Fest</h3>
           
            <p id="p">STEM is the acronym for Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics. Today’s students decide the future of our country and it is important that our country remains competitive in fields of science, technology and medicine. Hence, STEM is the best way to ensure that students are exposed to mathematics, science and technology throughout their educational career. The students of EPS are extremely curious and impressionable, so instilling an interest at an early age could spark a lasting desire to pursue a career in any of these fields. Excel Public School incorporates the STEM concepts in the teaching-learning experience of the learners from the Secondary stage.</p>

The School is run by Excel Education and E-Learning Trust, a non-profitable, charitable trust headquartered in Mysuru.
<br>
                    <br>
Since its humble inception in 2009, Excel Public School (EPS) has grown from being just another school in the city’s firmament, to an institution that is recognised for bringing about a transformation in the school education, synchronous with the contemporary global standards.
<br>
                    <br>
The founding principles of the school are clearly laid out to serve as the guiding light for all the stakeholders; they are clearly communicated and practiced to create and sustain an EPS culture among the members of the staff, students and parents. Emphasis is laid on value systems to create self-motivated, self-regulated individuals through various opportunities at school. This transforms them into sensitive and sensible individuals, empowered to make informed decisions and become the change agents for a better tomorrow.
<br>
                    <br>
The instructional strategies at Excel Public School are dynamic, contemporary and primarily constructivist, where technology plays the role of an effective enabler. Learning happens in a heterogeneous and inclusive ecosystem.
